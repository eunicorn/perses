# Perses Components Package

This [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@perses-dev/components) includes individual components used in the Perses app and plugins. These components are broken up in a way that allows embedding in separate applications outside of Perses. For more info about corresponding packages see the [general UI README here](https://github.com/perses/perses/blob/main/ui/README.md) and individual markdown files in each component folder.
